Create a beautiful, interactive HTML webpage that delivers a heartfelt message to a muse or special person. The page should be modern, professional, and visually appealing, with smooth animations and glowing highlights. 

Requirements:

1. **Animated Gradient Background**
   - Smoothly transitions between colors like pink, purple, blue, and gold.
   - Subtle, elegant movement to make the background dynamic.

2. **Glowing Title & Highlighted Words**
   - Main title and key words (like 'muse' and 'Mulax Prime') should glow using text-shadow.
   - Use <span> tags for highlighted words in paragraphs.

3. **Automatic Paragraph Reveal**
   - Each paragraph of the message fades in sequentially for a storytelling effect.
   - Use smooth opacity transitions with a delay of about 1.5s between paragraphs.

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Content centered and readable on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
   - Subtle shadows or cards for content emphasis.

5. **Clean Layout**
   - Minimalistic design, no childish emojis.
   - Focus on typography, spacing, and readability.

6. **JavaScript Animation**
   - Paragraphs automatically fade in one by one when the page loads.
   - Include optional gentle hover effect on highlighted words.

7. **Extra Flair (Optional)**
   - Add soft particle effects or background shape animations for elegance.

Deliver the **full HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code** in a single file so that it can be opened directly in a browser. Make the page feel like a personal, heartfelt message while being visually stunning and modern.
